**Problem Statement**

Criminal organisations are responsible for various illicit activities, which inevitably result in a reduced safety to the general public, as well as costing the government billions in damages every year. Unfortunately, the members, structure and overall reach of such organisations are very difficult to identify, a problem which is further exacerbated by the fact that many members of these organisations have been infiltrated within law enforcement agencies with the goal of facilitating their endeavours.

As it stands it would seem that law enforcement agencies are having a tough time keeping up with the task of eradicating these criminal entities, especially given that these criminal individuals can rather quickly reorganise themselves within a new organisation upon the dissolution of the previous. On the other hand, allowing these organisations to remain uncheck will result in the continuing proliferation of drugs and violent crimes, this is a problem we as a society need to correct.

**Description**: 

Explain what your project is trying to accomplish and how you utilized graph technology to achieve those goals. 
Describe how your submission is relevant to the problem statement and why it is impactful to the world. Remember to link your submission video here. 

Serious and organised crime is estimated to cost the UK economy at least Â£37 billion a year, hence the public funds which would be freed up as a result of identify and disrupting members of these organisations can be repurposed towards projects that can improve quality of life and infrastructure.

A major activity undertaken by these criminal organisations  is drug trafficking, this inevitably leads to thousands of people succumbing to addiction. As such, reducing the illegal import of drugs would inevitably result in an increase in public health, as well as increased workforce participation from individuals who might have otherwise become addicts. Furthermore, reduction in the occurrence of violent crimes would make for a safer environment for the general public.

Therefore, it is clear to see that the identification and subsequent disruption of these criminal organisations would greatly improve society both socially and financially. On the other hand, this use case of graph technology could drastically reduce the time taken for the structure of a crime organisation to be uncovered, and hence lead to faster and more plentiful abolition of such organisations. As well as a cleaner and more dedicated law enforcement agency.

Our project pushes the boundaries of what it means to be connected. We draw connections between individuals on a multitude of categories with varying importance, the connections generated go beyond what could be feasible with the naked eye.
Our schema encompasses data pertaining to members of the public, law enforcement agencies and criminal organisations. Ideally every citizen would be represented on this graph, thus allowing us to see how people link to one another, may it be through family ties, a transaction made regularly or once a few years ago, a message sent, or even a call received. The network generated from all these links would allow no connection to go unseen. 
Imagine a police force where all corrupt agents can be easily identified and perhaps even used without their knowledge to reach the criminals, imagine being able to determine all individuals belonging to these organisations and their structure, imagine the ability to determine location hotspots for criminal recruiting, and subsequently being able to implement government programmes to pacify such regions, in essence cutting these organisations from their supply of henchmen.
Implementing such a tool could allow a drastic reduction in the number of illicit activities and thus lead to a safer and more righteous society.


## Dependencies

This project requires the schema to be setup and mapped to the correct CSV files. More details are explained below.

## Installation

Please follow the steps below to access and run our project.

1. Clone repository to your local machine
2. Create Schema in Tiger Graph based on Entity Relationship Diagram here: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d96baedb-af78-451e-94b0-4280f7f729ec/edit?invitationId=inv_56e1a98e-557b-45a1-be90-a7c8c64a5ca7
3. Map the data file CSV's located in the "Data" folder to the Nodes and Edges
4. Copy and Paste the GSQL queries in the GSQL folder into the Tiger Graph query editor and run them.

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

The synthetic data was randomised and as a result it was difficult to show insights for everything. Future improvements include having access to real organised crime data.
